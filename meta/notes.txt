Logging files can only be done server side. Build a small express server to test file logging.
Write API documentation
Decrease size TestBed.js


Tests would be a good extra addition in the future, I left the a test file and base architecture that I wrote for a previous project, 
which could serve as a foundation to build on.

Add a "build" folder to the main 2 folders for just building the lib. You can test the lib in a copy of folder dev with the
build from the build folder.

If lengthOfNewLog > totalCharactersLogFile -> new file.
