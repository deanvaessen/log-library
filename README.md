# log-library + SDK

## Documentation
* Changelog in meta/changelog

## Getting started
* Clone

* Installing dependencies: npm run installdeps (give it a while)
** It might be possible to further enhance this build environment by merging /dev and /build,
but this was a good way to churn out a set-up that takes into account npm module creation.

** For developing: npm start / npm run dev (alternative: cd code/dev, npm start)
** For building: npm run build
** To production test (built library): npm run prod

# Library dependencies
* NodeJS
* FS
* Path
